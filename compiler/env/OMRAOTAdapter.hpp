 * @brief OMRAotAdapter, an extensible class that is designed to dispatch 
 * the interaction between compiler components to perform persisting of 
 * relocatable code. The benefit of having this class is in decoupling AOT-related
 * classes and removing indirect responsibility by introducing new separation of
 * responsibilities: the RelocationRuntime class is only concerned with managing 
 * the generation and application of relocations, without knowing about persisting
 * methods implemented in the current runtime environment. Similarly, Shared Cache
 * or other options for persisting code could implement a simplistic interface
 * (that, obviously can be extended) that would have two functions: receive a message
 * that contains a serialized version of the AOTMethod header, as well as send one.
 * The AOTAdapter will register the header and make it available to RelocationRuntime
 * and hence, the compiler, as well as to runtime environment, since AOTAdapter is
 * planned to be alive longer than a compilation thread.
